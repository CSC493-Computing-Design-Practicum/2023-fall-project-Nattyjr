      <h1> Our History</h1>

      <p>
        The idea for the travel website started back in the summer of 2023 when
        I was having a conversation witha friend to visit Ethiopia and found the
        process difficult and confusing. I thought there must be an easier way
        to research and book multi-destination travel. After doing some initial
        market research, I decided to launch a website that would allow
        travelers to not only book flights and hotels, but also plan custom
        multi-stop itineraries with helpful recommendations and travel tips.
